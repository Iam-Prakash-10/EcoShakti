# ðŸ”§ Eventlet Monkey Patch Fix

## Problem Solved
Fixed the eventlet monkey patching error: "make sure you run eventlet.monkey_patch() before importing any other modules"

## Root Cause
- Flask-SocketIO with eventlet worker was causing import order conflicts
- Eventlet monkey patching must happen before ANY other imports
- The application context errors were caused by eventlet trying to patch Flask objects

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Import Order in app.py
- Added conditional eventlet monkey patching at the very top
- Only patches in production mode to avoid development issues
- Moved Flask imports after the monkey patch

### 2. Switched from Eventlet to Gevent
- Updated gunicorn.conf.py to use `worker_class = "gevent"`
- Added gevent>=23.7.0 to requirements.txt
- Removed eventlet dependency to avoid conflicts

### 3. Updated All Startup Scripts
- render.yaml: Uses gevent worker
- start.sh: Direct gevent command
- start.py: Gevent worker configuration

## Current Configuration

### Render Start Command:
```bash
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 1 --worker-class gevent --timeout 30 --preload app:app
```

### Dependencies Added:
- gunicorn>=21.2.0
- gevent>=23.7.0

## Why Gevent Instead of Eventlet?
1. **Better Flask compatibility** - No monkey patching conflicts
2. **Simpler deployment** - No import order issues
3. **Still supports WebSockets** - Works perfectly with Flask-SocketIO
4. **More stable** - Less likely to cause production issues

## Expected Result
- No more eventlet monkey patch errors
- No more "Working outside of application context" errors
- Successful port binding on Render
- Working WebSocket connections

## If You Still See Issues
Try these start commands in order:

1. **Primary (Recommended):**
   ```bash
   gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 1 --worker-class gevent --timeout 30 --preload app:app
   ```

2. **Fallback 1:**
   ```bash
   python start.py
   ```

3. **Fallback 2:**
   ```bash
   gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 1 --timeout 30 app:app
   ```

The switch to gevent should resolve both the eventlet monkey patching issue and the port binding problem! ðŸš€
